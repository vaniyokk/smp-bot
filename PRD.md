- [ ] Test end-to-end workflow in GitHub Actions

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation

- [x] Test Notion API connection and data retrieval
- [ ] Validate AI content generation
- [ ] Test website automation (login, form filling, file upload)
- [ ] Verify YouTube API integration
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing

### Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment

- [ ] Update README with actual setup instructions
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document API requirements and permissions
- [ ] Finalize GitHub Actions workflow documentation

## Technical Requirements

### APIs & Integrations âœ…

- [x] Notion API v2 integration with proper authentication
- [x] OpenAI API integration for content generation
- [x] YouTube Data API v3 with OAuth2 flow
- [x] Target website form automation (Playwright)

### Infrastructure âœ…

- [x] GitHub Actions runner with Node.js 18+
- [x] Headless Chrome for Playwright automation
- [x] Secure secret management in GitHub
- [x] Comprehensive logging and error reporting

### Data Flow âœ…

- [x] Notion database schema validation
- [x] AI prompt engineering for content generation
- [x] Website form mapping and automation
- [x] YouTube video description updates
- [x] Status tracking back to Notion

## Success Criteria

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- [ ] Successfully fetch data from Notion database
- [ ] Generate enhanced descriptions using AI
- [ ] Automate website form filling and file upload
- [ ] Update YouTube video descriptions
- [ ] Update Notion with published URLs and status

### Quality Metrics

- [ ] 95% successful execution rate for complete workflow
- [ ] Proper error handling with actionable error messages
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for debugging
- [ ] Under 10-minute execution time per sheet music piece

### Security & Reliability

- [ ] All API keys stored as GitHub secrets
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in logs
- [ ] Graceful handling of network timeouts
- [ ] Rollback capability for failed operations

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status: Core Implementation Complete âœ…

**Next Action**: Test end-to-end workflow in GitHub Actions

**Progress: 85% Complete**

- âœ… Foundation, core services, and configuration all implemented
- âœ… TypeScript + ESLint with strict type checking
- âœ… Pre-commit hooks preventing bad commits
- ðŸ”„ Ready for end-to-end testing phase

### Key Decisions Made

- **Platform**: GitHub Actions for hosting and execution
- **Trigger Method**: Manual workflow dispatch (perfect for POC)
- **Languages**: Node.js + TypeScript for robust typing
- **Web Automation**: Playwright for reliable browser automation
- **AI Provider**: OpenAI API for content generation

### Risk Mitigation

- [ ] Website changes breaking automation (solution: selector validation)
- [ ] API rate limiting (solution: proper retry logic with backoff)
- [ ] Large file uploads timing out (solution: timeout configuration)
- [ ] YouTube API quota limits (solution: usage monitoring)

## Future Enhancements (Post-POC)

- [ ] Support for multiple sheet music websites
- [ ] Batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Scheduled automatic runs (cron triggers)
- [ ] Advanced AI prompt customization
- [ ] Integration with additional platforms (Instagram, TikTok)
- [ ] Analytics and reporting dashboard
